    thinking that you are at the same piece as before, but you are mistaken. Try interacting with this piece.
    I actually find this piece much harder to enjoy since the motion of the bubbles as I move them is fast and
    erratic, which is quite strange since the movement is dictated by simple rules, wheras many pieces I have
    feel a lot smoother but are not random. Like chaos theory, this is random for order as opposed to the
    other way around.</span></p>
