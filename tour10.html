    is a quite literal example of pushing what art can be. I think that most can agree this is art, other
    than those who regect the idea that computer art/random art is art, yet the canvas moves. This literal
    space that had to contain art is now moving. This piece is also one of the purest expressions of the
    theme of bouncing bubbles of random colors.</span></p>
